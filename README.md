# go-packages
A large repository of code and documented examples for Go's standard package library.

##### I will within the next week or so, start systematically going through each package to make sure all errors are handled, as well as making sure that all methods/functions are understandable to beginners. (I only wrote what I needed to learn the standard lib when I started Go so some things aren't well documented). When I'm finished with that, I'll eventually get around to adding packages that are missing such as context and httptrace since they weren't around back when I started Go and also other confusing to beginner packages like all the packages in the go package subtree (eg. ast)/testing/debug? etc.

`go-packages` is a large collection of code examples and documentation for a large majority of the functions and methods from Go's standard package library.

These examples were mostly put together from when I was first learning Go.
A chunk of these examples were found by Googling for things that I was unsure about when first learning Go and were either put together or modified from Googled answers or the https://golang.org/pkg website, or just simply created from scratch to teach myself how to use as many of Go's functions and methods as I possibly could when I first started.

Some of the codebase should be refactored to make sure every single error is being checked since a lot of this codebase was created to power through learning the standard package library. Plenty of documentation will probably be in time refactored/updated to reflect changes in the standard library since these were created/more examples will probably come since a fair amount is still missing from these examples.
