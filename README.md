# go-packages
A large repository of code and documented examples for Go's standard package library.

`go-packages` is a large collection of code examples and documentation for a large majority of the functions and methods from Go's standard package library.

These examples were mostly put together from when I was first learning Go.
A chunk of these examples were found by Googling for examples that I was unsure about when first learning Go, but majority of the examples were ether put together or modified from Googled answers or the https://golang.org/pkg website or just created to teach myself how to use as many of Go's functions and methods as I possibly could when I first started.

Some of the codebase should be refactored to make sure every single error is being checked since a lot of this codebase was created to power through learning the standard package library. Plenty of documentation will probably be in time refactored/updated to reflect changes in the standard library since these were created/more examples will probably come since a fair amount is still missing from these examples.
